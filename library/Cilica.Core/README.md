# Bounded Cilica core library

`CoreTypes.cs` contains Cilica-owned runtime declarations, compiled without a
platform CoreLib. Primitive declarations support the compiler's predefined type
identities; their presence does not implement every primitive operation. Strings
and the selected exception family use Cilica's existing native payloads and
tracing. Unsupported runtime members remain body/operation diagnostics rather
than returning placeholder values.

Build with the local evidence producer:

```sh
dotnet tools/Cilica.LibraryBuild/bin/Debug/net10.0/Cilica.LibraryBuild.dll \
  --compiler-directory /path/to/dotnet/sdk/10.0.400/Roslyn/bincore \
  --profile core --assembly-name Cilica.Core \
  --source library/Cilica.Core/CoreTypes.cs \
  --intrinsic-requests library/Cilica.Core/intrinsic-requests.json \
  --output-directory artifacts/library-build/core
```

The output directory must be new. No platform references are passed. The request
file describes 59 exact string/exception/invariant-provider capabilities for review; it does not
approve them. The build records actual compiler/source/options hashes and emitted
declarations. Admission still requires an independently approved manifest digest.
No build output is automatically added to the trusted baseline.

`CoreLibraryBuildTests` builds this source and maps its admitted declarations
against the pinned .NET Standard 2.1 reference image. Four native probes match
.NET at O0/O2 with ASan/UBSan, collection before allocations, repeated calls,
frame exhaustion and ownership cleanup. They cover UTF-16 strings, exception
messages/parameter names, stable invariant-provider identity and composition with the ported decimal helper. Missing
approval and unsupported string hashing fail explicitly.

This is a bounded core trial. Numeric `ToString` APIs, general culture/provider members,
StringBuilder, collections, full reflection and general CoreLib compatibility
remain unimplemented. The image is metadata input to Cilica, never loaded into
the host CLR. See ADRs 0131–0132 for scope and review evidence.
